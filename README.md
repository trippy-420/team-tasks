## 📖 About team-tasks

team-tasks helps you manage complex workflows made up of multiple AI agents. These agents can work together in different ways, such as one after another, branching paths, or debating to find the best answer. This means you can use team-tasks to coordinate tasks that need clear steps, decision-making, or friendly argument among AI helpers.

The software supports three main modes to fit different needs:

- **Linear mode:** Agents handle tasks one by one in a fixed order.
- **DAG mode:** Agents work on tasks following a map with branches and merges.
- **Debate mode:** Agents discuss different views to reach a solution.

You don’t need to know how to code to use team-tasks. It comes with a simple interface to help you set up and run your AI teams smoothly.
